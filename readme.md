# Project Management System

<br /> <div align="center"> <h3 align="center">Project Management System</h3> <p align="center"> A comprehensive platform to manage projects, tasks, and deadlines with role-based access control. <br /> <br /> <a href="https://matriceai-assignment-6dnd.onrender.com/">View Demo</a> </p> </div>

### About The Project

The Project Management System is designed to simplify project management by providing role-based access to administrators, project managers, and team members. Each user type has specific rights to manage and view projects, tasks, and deadlines. The system features robust JWT authentication and session management, ensuring secure and persistent access to the platform.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

### Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-management-system.git
```

2. Navigate to the client directory and install NPM packages

```sh
cd client
npm install
```

3. Navigate to the server directory and install NPM packages

```sh
cd ../server
npm install
```

4. Set up your .env file in the 'server' directory with the following:

```sh
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

5. Set up your .env file in the 'client' directory with the following:

```sh
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

6. Run the application

- Start the frontend

```sh
cd client
npm run dev
```
- Start the backend
```sh
cd ../server
node app.js
```

7. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5173 to access the frontend.

<!-- SYSTEM DESIGN -->

### System Design
- Backend Architecture
The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, connected to a MongoDB database. The architecture follows a RESTful API pattern with JWT authentication for secure and persistent user sessions. Role-based middleware ensures that only authorized users can access specific routes and perform certain actions.

- Frontend Architecture
The frontend is built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. Redux is used for state management, with redux-persist ensuring that user sessions persist even after a page refresh. The frontend interacts with the backend through Axios, handling all API requests securely with JWT tokens.

<!-- DATABASE SCHEMA -->

### Database Schema
- User Schema

```sh
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
name: { type: String, required: true },
email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
password: { type: String, required: true },
designation: { type: String, required: true }, // 'admin', 'project manager', 'team member'
isApproved: { type: Boolean, default: false },
});
```

- Project Schema

```sh
const projectSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
name: { type: String, required: true },
description: { type: String, required: true },
deadline: { type: Date, required: true },
teamLeader: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
teamMembers: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }],
});
```

- Task Schema

```sh
const taskSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
name: { type: String, required: true },
description: { type: String },
deadline: { type: Date, required: true },
project: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Project', required: true },
assignedTo: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }],
});
```
